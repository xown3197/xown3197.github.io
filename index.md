## About Me

Thanks for visiting my website!
I am a Ph.D. studnet (M.S./PH.D. INTEGRATED PROGRAM) at [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://www.rcv.sejong.ac.kr/). at Sejong University. (Advisor: Prof. [Yukyung Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMrPtrAAAAAJ&hl=en)).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on developing **Physical AI** that enables robots to perform generalizable manipulation tasks in indoor environments. I integrate **Language Model Programs** (LMPs) and **3D Language Fields** to enhance task planning, spatial reasoning, and execution adaptability through language-friendly 3D representations.

Through this approach, my goal is to develop robots that reconstruct task spaces, refine actions through imagination, and autonomously adapt to complex tasks.
