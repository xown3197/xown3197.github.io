## About Me

Thanks for visiting my website!
I am a Ph.D. studnet (M.S./PH.D. INTEGRATED PROGRAM) at [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://www.rcv.sejong.ac.kr/). at Sejong University. (Advisor: Prof. [Yukyung Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMrPtrAAAAAJ&hl=en)).

## Research Interests
My research has focused on **environment-robust 3D visual perception**, enhancing a robotâ€™s ability to recognize and understand its surroundings in challenging conditions. With recent advancements in generative AI and foundation models, robots are becoming increasingly capable of performing generalizable manipulation tasks beyond specific pre-defined actions.

Building on this progress, I am particularly interested in developing **Physical AI** for indoor environments, integrating **language model programs** and **3D language field** to improve task planning, spatial reasoning, and execution adaptability. My goal is to enable robots to reconstruct task spaces, refine actions through imagination, and maintain robust perception and decision-making even in complex and dynamic environments.

<!-- I am interested in developing Physical AI that enables robots to perform generalizable manipulation tasks in indoor environments. My research explores the integration of Language Model Programs (LMPs) and 3D Language Fields to enhance task planning, spatial reasoning, and execution adaptability through language-embedded 3D representations.

Through this approach, I aim to investigate how robots can reconstruct task spaces, refine actions through imagination, and autonomously adapt to complex tasks, improving their ability to interact with dynamic environments. -->
